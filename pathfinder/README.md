# Assignment A4: pathfinder

-   Saad Salman [salmam12@mcmaster.ca]

# Rationale:
The  A4 rationale includes the goal to create a generation mechanism for urbanists to explore settlements 
and urbanism development on the island generation created in previous project. 

# Extending the Library
The task purpose is to implement a new algorithm that can be used to create an island map with road maps from
one city to another by the shortest distance. In order to cacluate that, the library already contains 
an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm modified to find shortest distance between 2 nodes also known as cities.
The library ADT helps to integrate into a island generator and visualize the roads.
